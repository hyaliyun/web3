An **accent** is a typically bright color that contrasts with the more utilitarian background and foreground colors within a color scheme. These are present in the visual style of many platforms (though not all).

On the web, an accent is sometimes used in  elements for the active portion of the control, for instance, the background of a checked [checkbox](/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox).
