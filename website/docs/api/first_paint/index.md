**First Paint** is the time between navigation and when the browser first renders pixels to the screen, rendering anything that is visually different from the default [background color](/Web/CSS/background-color) of the [body](/Web/API/Document/body). It is the first key moment in page load and will answer the question "Has the browser started to render the page?"
