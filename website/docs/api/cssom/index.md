The [**CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**](/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model) is a set of APIs for reading and modifying a document's style-related (CSS) information. In other words, similar to the way in which the [DOM](/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) enables a document's structure and content to be read and modified from JavaScript, the CSSOM allows the document's styling to be read and modified from JavaScript.
