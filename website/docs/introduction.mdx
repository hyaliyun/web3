Why you should use your Google Business Profile

If your business shows up in these listings, you can reap benefits such as:

More visibility in search results: For searches like, “restaurants near me” or “hotels in Harrisburg,” Google will often show a list of local service businesses near the top of the results. To capture this prime real estate, you want an optimized Google Business Profile.
Ease of navigation for local customers: Because these profiles are tied to Google Maps, all a user has to do is tap or click for directions. Talk about easy!
Added trust in your business: Because your profile can include pictures and customer reviews, it also helps users get a better idea of your business. These elements help build trust (even if you’re a part of a well-known franchise), making users more likely to want to stop by.

To set up Google My Business, or your Google Business Profile, you’ll first need a Google account. If you already have one, sign in to it.

Otherwise, you’ll want to create a new one using your business email domain. On the setup screen, be sure to click “Create account” and select the option “To manage my business.”

To do so, search for it at business.google.com/create. Type your business name into the search bar and see if an existing profile appears. If so, select it from the dropdown. From here, skip to step 4.

Find your business on Google

When you select your business from the dropdown, Google might inform you that someone else is already managing the profile. If so, you can request access by clicking the button.

If you didn’t find your business in step 2, never fear! Just follow these steps to create a new Google Business Profile: At business.google.com/create, click “Add your business to Google.” Then, follow the on-screen prompts and jump to step 4.
