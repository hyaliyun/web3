What is Google Maps?
Google Maps is a web service that provides detailed information about geographical regions and sites worldwide. In addition to conventional road maps, Google Maps offers aerial and satellite views of many locations. In some cities, Google Maps offers street views comprising photographs taken from vehicles.

Google Maps offers several services as part of the larger web application. For example, a route planner offers directions for drivers, bikers, walkers and users of public transportation traveling from one specific location to another.

Supplemental services offer images of the moon, Mars and the heavens for hobby astronomers.
