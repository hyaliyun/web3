The **unknown element** error is a [WebDriver error](/Web/WebDriver/Errors) that occurs when an unspecified error occurs in the driver whilst processing a [command](/Web/WebDriver/Commands).

An unknown error will usually be specific to a particular driver, so it's a good idea to read the error message, if any, for an indication of what happened.
