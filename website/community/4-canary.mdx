What is Web 3.0? Understanding Web3 decentralized Internet

Have you ever pondered how the Internet works? And we’re not just talking about Web 2.0—today’s Internet of search engines, corporate websites, social media, and ultra-useful information sites like Encyclopædia Britannica—but tomorrow’s Internet. It’s called Web 3.0 or Web3, and it’s a blockchain-based Internet that uses decentralized technology to operate.

Web3 Internet is a technological innovation over Web 2.0—today’s Internet—because it gives digital control and privacy back to Internet users. Web3 visionaries see user empowerment and digital sovereignty as core values.

But note: Many of the applications and Web3 building blocks are still in their infancy. Some are more theoretical than actual.

What is Web3?
Web3 Internet uses blockchain technology—the same technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—to make the decentralized Internet more secure and private. Web3 systems are technology protocols controlled by computer code to facilitate direct and secure communications among users, applications, and data. Blockchain technology, decentralized data storage, and peer-to-peer networking are the necessary components of a decentralized Internet.

Web3 advocates are excited about the potential of Web3 technology to make the Internet more user-centric. Web3 can potentially democratize financial systems by removing centralized decision-makers and geographic borders from the Internet.

Web 2.0 vs. Web 3.0 (and do you remember Web 1.0)?
Web2 is what you know as the Internet today—a social place that enables you to easily interact with content and people. If you’re old enough to remember the Internet before Amazon, YouTube, and iPhones, then you may remember that the first version of the Internet, Web1, was read-only.

Here’s how the Web3 cheerleaders see the Internet evolving from today’s Web2 in terms of data control, commercial applications, data security, and other features.

Data ownership. Web2 platforms like Google and Facebook own and control the data created by users who access their platforms. Web3 places ownership and control of data solely with Internet users, who can decide exactly how their data is used.

Monetization. Web2 platforms leverage their ownership of user data to make money by charging digital advertisers for access to targeted audiences. A Web3 protocol uses cryptocurrency to incentivize individual users everywhere to operate the platform. Web3 users can leverage the technology to monetize their products and services by transacting directly with other peers on the network.

Security. Have you ever been informed that your data was exposed in a security breach? Centralized Web2 servers can be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Fully decentralized networks offer the promise of greater safety.

Censorship resistance. How important is free speech? The centralized nature of a Web2 platform makes it possible to censor and restrict access to the platform’s content. Web3 Internet protocols resist censorship by enabling the decentralized generation and distribution of information.

Reliance on trust. Would you conduct business online using just any website? Centralized Web2 platforms need users to trust them to operate successfully. Web3 technology can support trustless systems—protocols that use blockchain technology to eliminate the need for faith in any counterparty.

Points of failure. Centralized Internet platforms create single points of failure—a Web2 platform that experiences serious technical problems can impact many people. Web3 systems are decentrally operated and—by design—have no single point of failure.

Eight examples of Web3 applications
Web3 applications—better known as decentralized applications or dApps—have the potential to transform the financial system and create new opportunities within a growing Web3 network.

The world already has many potentially useful decentralized protocols and apps. Here are eight examples that may move to the mainstream as Web3 picks up steam.

Ethereum. Perhaps the best-known Web3 protocol, this decentralized platform supports a native cryptocurrency plus a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. The Ethereum platform hosts most of the Web3 apps that exist today.
Brave. Brave is a Web3-based browser that enables users to directly monetize their content consumption and creation. Users are rewarded for viewing ads and can be compensated directly for producing original content.
Uniswap. This Ethereum-based protocol supports a decentralized exchange that aims to be a Web3 version of today’s stock and commodity exchanges. Governance of the Uniswap protocol is also decentralized, with full control distributed among UNI tokenholders.
Aave. This Web3 lending and borrowing platform enables users to earn interest on deposits, plus borrow assets without requiring approval from centralized intermediaries.
RealT. Real estate investors may be interested in RealT, a Web3 app that aims to tokenize real estate. RealT allows investors to earn rental income from fractional ownership shares in properties.
Set protocol. Internet users can access the Set protocol to automate investing and rebalancing of crypto assets. The protocol uses Web3 tech to enable investors to predefine their investing rules and strategies. Perhaps, one day, the protocol could move from crypto assets to traditional asset classes.
Nexus Mutual. Web3 technology can support decentralized insurance platforms, and Nexus Mutual is exactly that. The platform is focused on insuring crypto holdings and covering smart contract failures.
InstaDApp. This Web3 banking portal aims to simplify access to multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The dApp features portfolio management and debt refinancing tools.
Notably, Bitcoin is not generally considered a Web3 protocol. Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto as a store of value akin to digital gold. The Bitcoin network does not support advanced smart contract functionality or an ecosystem of dApps, limiting its use outside of blockchain-verified payments.

The bottom line
Imagine a digital world in which major tech companies don’t control your data or curate your online experiences. Mass adoption of Web3 may mark a paradigm shift in the modern Internet landscape, creating new opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and financial empowerment.

Although we’re still in the early stages of Web3 creation and adoption, there’s no denying the potential of emerging technology to—once again—give the economy an overhaul. Responsible investors would be wise to consider the many potential impacts of Web3, as it could become the future of all things financial.
